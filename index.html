							<h3>McDonald’s Patties “sixty-two percent wildebeest on average”</h3>

							  <p>OCTOBER 17, 2025 - An investigation was launched Friday morning after a customer reported a meat patty was  “terribly rubbery.”  Thorough testing of patties from multiple restaurants indicated the patties contained an average of sixty-two percent wildebeest meat. When confronted, CEO Chris Kempczinski stated it was a  “cost-cutting measure,”  and  “probably edible.” McDonald’s employees were interviewed to gather further information on the subject. It was found that ninety-eight percent of employees interviewed had  “no idea”  that the burgers contained wildebeest. All imports and exports of wildebeest have ceased as per new orders from the FDA. Food service and safety regulations are likely to become even stricter in affected areas, with larger fines for non-compliance. McDonald’s is set to lose up to $800,000,000 in fines within the next month, and stock prices have plummeted over fifty percent.</p>

							  <p>OCTOBER 9, 2025 - Congress has just passed 82 U.S.C. § 6(c) (2025), a law stating that  “all those that expose, ‘whistle-blow,’  disclose classified information without authorization and/or while under legal contract such as NDA or other means, or speak negatively of the United States Government will be mandated to partake in projectile-based disciplinary action, including but not limited to: volcanic insertion via federally sanctioned launch apparatus, including cannons, rockets, and giant slingshots.” In summary, anybody that leaks classified information, exposes a corporation for any sort of wrongdoings, or violate a non-disclosure agreement are immediately subject to being launched dramatically into volcanoes. The passing of this law made most of the country incredibly unhappy. However, mega corporations like Boeing have expressed their gratitude to the Government.</p>
